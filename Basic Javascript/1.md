// var
var is used to declare variables and it's value can be changed.

Example-
var camper = "James";
var camper = "David";
console.log(camper);

In the code above, the camper variable is originally declared as James, and is then overridden to be David. 
The console then displays the string David.


// let
let is used for a purpose

Example-
let camper = "James";
let camper = "David";

The error can be seen in your browser console.

So unlike var, when you use let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.

// const
Variables are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned:

Example-
const FAV_PET = "Cats";
FAV_PET = "Dogs";

The console will display an error due to reassigning the value of FAV_PET.
