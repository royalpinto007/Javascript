arr[3] is [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14], arr[3][0] is [10, 11, 12], and arr[3][0][1] is 11.

Note: There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0][0] and even this array [0] [0] is not allowed. 
Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.
