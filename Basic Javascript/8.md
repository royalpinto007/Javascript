That's where .shift() comes in. 
It works just like .pop(), except it removes the first element instead of the last.

// pop() removes the last element and shift() removes the first element


.unshift() works exactly like .push().
But instead of adding the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.
