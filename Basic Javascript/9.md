a queue is an abstract Data Structure where items are kept in order. 
New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.

// push()
The push() method adds an item to the end of an array.

// shift()
The shift() method removes the first element of an array. 
It also returns the element removed.


Write a function nextInLine which takes an array (arr) and a number (item) as arguments.
Add the number to the end of the array, then remove the first element of the array.
The nextInLine function should then return the element that was removed.


function nextInLine(arr, item) 
{
  arr.push(item);
  var firstItem = arr.shift(arr);
  return firstItem;
}

// if operator
function test (myCondition) {
  if (myCondition) {
    return "It was true";
  }
  return "It was false";
}

test(true);
test(false);
