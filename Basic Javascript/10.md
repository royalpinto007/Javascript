1   ==  1  // true
1   ==  2  // false
1   == '1' // true
"3" ==  3  // true

// ===
Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). 
However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type.
The strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.

3 ===  3  // true
3 === '3' // false
In the second example, 3 is a Number type and '3' is a String type.

// typeof
typeof 3  // int
typeof '3' // string

// !=
1 !=  2    // true
1 != "1"   // false
1 != '1'   // false
1 != true  // false
0 != false // false

// !==
The strict inequality operator (!==) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. 
It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns false where strict equality would return true and vice versa. 
The strict inequality operator will not convert data types.

3 !==  3  // false
3 !== '3' // true
4 !==  3  // true
